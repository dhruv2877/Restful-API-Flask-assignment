These requests usually contain form data, JSON payloads, or file uploads. Flask handles POST requests using the @app.route() decorator with methods=['POST'], and the request data can be accessed using Flaskâ€™s request object (request.form for form data, request.json for JSON data, etc.).\n",

A Flask API can be secured through authentication, authorization, input validation, using HTTPS in place of HTTP, rate limiting, and secure database practices.

Unlike cookies, which store data directly on the clientâ€™s browser, the session data in Flask is stored securely on the server (but can also be signed and stored in cookies using Flaskâ€™s default configuration).
